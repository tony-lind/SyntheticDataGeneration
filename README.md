The code is the basis for the paper: "Low dimensional synthetic data generation for improving data driven prognostic models" 
In order to re-run the experiment in the paper or just use the some of the synethtic data generation methods the following steps needs to be done.

Install all packages needed for running the code

In all files, adjusting the codes behaviour is done by '#' to hide certain parts of the code.  
Files:\
syntetic_data_from_embedding.py - creates synthetic data and writes the synthetic examples to disc\
line 27-32 define where to write your data, change this according to your preference\
line 34 update path to where you have put the embeddings data, i.e. embeddings.txt\
line 155 de-comment if you want to use KDE or KDE with check\
line 169 de-comment if you want to use KDE with check\
line 181-190 de-comment the method you want to run

evaluation_baseline_kfold.py - runs experiment with the baseline method, i.e, no usage of sythetic data and write result to file named 'result_no_syn'.\
line 193-195 update path to where you have put the embeddings data, i.e. embeddings.txt

evaluation_synthetic_kfold.py - runs experiment with the synthetic data generated and write result to file.\
line 193-195 path were you put the synthetic data and embeddings.txt

cost_size_plot - plot figure 4 in the paper, i.e., cost-size result for all methods\
line 15-21 update path to where you have the results for each method

learning_curves.py - plot figure 5 in the paper, i.e., learning curve for basline methods and SMOTE\
line 26-29 update path to where you have put the embeddings data, i.e. embeddings.txt\
As is the learning curve for basline data will be plotted. To plot synthetic data:\

line 37-39 de-comment\ 
line 47-49 comment away\
line 50-52 de-comment

t_sne_baseline_plotting.py - plot figure 3\
line 54-56 update path to where you have put the embeddings data, i.e. embeddings.txt

t_sne_synthetic_plotting.py - plot figure 6\
line 64-66 update path to where you have put the embeddings data, i.e. embeddings.txt\
line 77-79 update to path where your synthetic data are
